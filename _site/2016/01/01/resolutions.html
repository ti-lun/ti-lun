    <p>Haha, everytime I write New Year’s resolutions, I can’t find where I put it a year later so that I could reflect upon it.  Since I’ve gone to such lengths to set up this blog, hopefully it’ll be nested comfortably in permanence.</p>

<h3>This Year's Resolutions</h3>

<p>I think to make them actually doable and trackable, I should make the resulting habits or goals concrete.  Most if not all of these goals are about routinization.</p>

<ol>
	<li><b><i>Eating processed sweets only once every three days</i></b></li>
	This problem's bad enough to warrant its own tier, lol. It's not even in a cute way, like how L from Death Note childishly eats strawberries and eclairs. Lots of money goes wasted from tossing out actual, healthy food that ends up rotting in the fridge because I'd end up replacing meals with sugary cereal or cookies (sob).  An exception I'm going to make, though, is fruit.  It's got vitamins and fiber!
	<br /><br />
	<li><b><i>To</i></b> verb <b><i>a</i></b> noun <b><i>a</i></b> time frame</li>
		<ul>
			<li>To read a book a month</li>
			<li>To cook homemade food every other day</li>
			<li>To tidy up my room every Sunday</li>
			<li>To do an algorithm problem every day</li>
			<li>To write something, digitally or on paper, every day</li>
			<li>To work on ONE personal project every day</li>
			<li>To watch a whole TV/anime series (up to 50 episodes) every break</li>
			<li>To beat a video game every quarter</li>
			<li>To go outside every day</li>
			<li>To do something <i>entirely for no reason</i> every day</li>
		</ul>
		I'm sure there's going to be more added to this at some point.
	<br /><br />
	<li><b><i>Controlling my compulsiveness</i></b></li>
	It was not until just a couple weeks ago I realized that I tend to be pretty compulsive.  While it's done some pretty good things for me in the past--a great three-day trip to L.A. to see a concert the week before finals, for example--it's also caused me quite a bit of damage in the long-run.
<br /><br />
	<ul>
		<li>An example is buying things.  As I was growing up, my mother was (and still is) very compulsive about making huge, luxurious purchases (like buying a pair of $1500 shoes she didn't even like).  I thought it was normal, until I faced the challenges of carrying that poor habit to college.  After whittling my budget down to subsisting on rice and soy sauce a couple of times, I finally got my crap together.</li>
<br />
		<li>What I'm struggling with now is health.  I mentioned my sweet tooth above; I have an compulsiveness to substitute sweets for healthy food.  Worse yet, I love eating a lot of finger foods at once.  Man, those days where I had a giant bag of Rold Gold thins for all my meals...  What I'm going to do is time myself as I'm eating something.  If I'm eating cereal, for instance, I have to choose a brand where the pieces are reasonably large, and then time myself to eat one piece/minute. </li> 
<br />
		<li>I also find it difficult right now to focus doing just <i>one</i> thing for more than ten or fifteen minutes, unless I'm relentlessly crazy about it.  In other words, I want to routinize my workflow, since it sort of resembles a fireworks show rather than the consistent glow of the sun.  The easiest way to go about this is probably to just catch myself being super unfocused or being super intense, and then correct it.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><b><i>To feel other people's emotions more strongly</i></b></li>
	After playing an awesome game called <i>Undertale</i>, I realized that much of people's troubles stem from the inability to relate and communciate correctly.  As for me, I'm an intensely emotional person... but mostly for things that occur in my life.  That extent of emotional-ness doesn't need to concern everybody in the world, but I do want to be able to care very deeply about others.  So what I want to do is pray for someone (not necessarily anyone I know) every day.  Maybe I could go further with this later.
	<br /><br />
	<li><b><i>Make learning technical stuff as seamless as possible</i></b></li>
	It takes a lot of energy and mind-bending to understand code.  Really, I think it all comes down to being comfortable with understanding how stuff fits and works together--mechanics, and why that stuff could be expanded to other stuff that doesn't exist yet--design (maybe mathematics).
	<br /><br />
	So every day, these are some activities that could be done to help out with that kind of thinking:
	<br /><br />
	<ul>
		<li>Drawing something, like cars or buildings or cats, from every perspective (front, back, 3/4, skewed angles, etc.)</li>
		<li>Reading and sketching how everyday objects operate (e.g. how does a toaster work?</li>
		<li>Straight-up doing algorithms</li>
		<li>Assembling stuff together, like sewing clothing</li>
	</ul>
</ol>

<p>Alright, I think five for now is pretty good.  :)
Good luck to everyone this year!  I hope everyone achieves what they set out to do.  As Shia LaBouf says, “Don’t let your dreams be dreams.”</p>
