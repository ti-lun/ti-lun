    <p>Anyone who has known me long enough knows that my parents and I really, <em>really</em>, don&#8217;t get along<em>.</em>  Anyone who&#8217;s been with me since high school knows for sure that in particular, my relationship with my psychotic mother is the cause of a lot of problems that our family has had, and I have lacked a lot of &#8220;normal experiences&#8221; that other children had.</p>
<p>&#8220;Psychotic&#8221;?  <em>Katie, that&#8217;s a bit extreme, isn&#8217;t it?</em>  No, I really do mean &#8220;psychotic&#8221; in the sense that my mother has these delusions of what life is like and overreacts emotionally to these delusions.  For instance: my dad tells my mom, &#8220;Hey, wait!!  Close the door, close the door, you&#8217;re letting all the cold air in!!&#8221;&#8211;and suddenly my mom believes that she&#8217;s being persecuted and abused.  Having grown up in her cage and having escaped it, I can safely say that my mother is mentally ill in some manner and is toxic for the people she&#8217;s living with.</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of my past blog posts (bosts?  lol), I&#8217;m not going to give a lengthy, detailed account of my Thanksgiving break just to prove a singular point: my &#8220;family&#8221; is shitty.  Instead, I&#8217;m going to give a voice to the thought that&#8217;s been lingering in my head, meant to rouse me from the rut that I&#8217;ve fallen in for past couple of weeks: <strong>grow up</strong>.</p>
<p><span id="more-272"></span></p>
<p>I had just finished watching <em>Bojack Horseman</em>, a great cartoon that thinly veils strong criticism and commentary on American society with stoner humor and black humor.  If you haven&#8217;t watched it yet and you don&#8217;t give two shits about propriety, you&#8217;ve gotta watch this show!  The premise is that a washed-up middle-aged actor, eponymous of the show, struggles to deal with his self-esteem after starring in a popular 90&#8217;s family sitcom.</p>
<p>Throughout some of the episodes, the concept of &#8220;family&#8221; is challenged and morphed by the characters in the show.  There&#8217;s the&#8221;family&#8221; in the sitcom that Bojack and other characters created, made of a surrogate father and three orphans.  There&#8217;s the &#8220;family&#8221; that the director of the sitcom, Herb Kazzaz, told the cast to maintain even outside of the show, if only because showbiz is hard.  There&#8217;s Charlotte&#8217;s &#8220;family&#8221; that looks great on the outside, but is threatened by Bojack&#8217;s presence; Charlotte finds herself more attracted to Bojack than her husband, and Charlotte&#8217;s daughter finds herself attracted to having sex with Bojack because she finds herself treated like a child with everyone else (especially her &#8220;family&#8221;).</p>
<p>All these examples show that a lot of people try to &#8220;play house,&#8221; try to construct a pretty family, and try to put the pieces together so that their ideal thing of &#8220;family&#8221; is accomplished.*  I really do mean the word &#8220;construct&#8221; because there&#8217;s definitely artifice here.  The funny thing is, <em>so many people</em> try so hard to construct a family.  Eventually they dedicate so much of their lives to it that it&#8217;s all they really have in the end.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>My parents and I fight every time I come home for the holidays.  It amazes me that this time around, I didn&#8217;t cry on the first two days of getting back (I did a little bit on the third).  But it amazes me <em>more</em> that, for some reason, we keep investing hundreds of dollars to fly me home for the holidays.  On one day we have an argument; the next we&#8217;re discussing airline flights back to San Jose.</p>
<p>So after my mom burst in the door to angrily yell at me having not packed up yet, to instigate a debate, and to leave everyone in a sour mood, I realized that there was <em>nothing</em> to come back home for.  For one, it makes answering to people who ask, &#8220;How was your holiday?&#8221; <em>really awkward.</em></p>
<p>In seriousness, though, the internet connection here is awful, I eat vegan so it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m coming home to &#8220;Mom&#8217;s cooking,&#8221; my parents have no hobbies and are incapable of holding a conversation that isn&#8217;t about money with me, and we disagree on enough things that we get riled up about it.**</p>
<p>I told my dad to get a refund for the tickets back home during Christmas.  Judging from his reaction, I think he didn&#8217;t take me seriously at first.</p>
<blockquote><p>Me:  Hey, can you get a refund for the tickets back home?  I&#8217;ve got a place to stay for winter break, so there&#8217;s no need to worry about that.</p>
<p>Dad:  Well, ha, but it&#8217;s winter vacation.  You might as well go back home, right?</p>
<p>Me:  Haha, Dad, being here is no &#8220;vacation.&#8221;  Trust me.</p>
<p>Dad:  But you come back for family.</p>
<p>Me:  You guys&#8230; you guys try <em>so hard</em> to uphold this thing you keep calling a &#8220;family.&#8221;  Show it to me.  Where is it?  What kind of family is like this?</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230; Then my dad goes off into complaining about my mom&#8217;s neurosis and tendency to blow up at any little thing.</p>
<p>Things that happen in my family suddenly make a lot of sense to me now.  I mean, I knew it earlier, but now I see it clearly enough to be a rotating gear, a mechanical force that has been churning away long enough to be traceable and understandable.</p>
<p>My parents are an extreme version of the American dream.  (&#8220;Extreme American dream.&#8221;  lol.)  They came from Vietnam with little, worked their tails off to buy five houses, sent their kid to college without government loans, drove dream cars, wore overpriced jewelry that could have paid for my college expenses anyway, and ate gigantic, expensive meals of tiny courses.  I think the pinnacle of this is when my mom bought <a href="http://s4.postimg.org/uzb70k0ql/Photo_by_Bengt_Enrique.jpg">these shoes</a> for about $1200 and never, ever wore them.  When I asked why she bought them, she said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know!  I just had so much money to spend!&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet they are pretty unhappy and irritable.  I know this, because they&#8217;re in their late 50&#8217;s/early 60&#8217;s (not that old) and yet they&#8217;re blaming everything on their age, and blaming everything on their bosses, on their children, on lawyers, on everyone except themselves.  And many notions of change or individuality either provoke some unwarranted comment from them&#8211;today I wore a snood and my dad said pointedly, &#8220;That&#8217;s way too thick for your neck&#8221; with a grimace&#8211;or sends them into a rage because they&#8217;ve been bottling up their insecurities.  Last &#8220;break,&#8221; I told my mom that we shouldn&#8217;t buy a fifth house because we&#8217;re already very deep in debt and she began screaming and accusing me of questioning her authority and leadership in the family.***</p>
<p>And they are insecure.  My mom, who looks pretty good for her age, still asks me, &#8220;Is it okay if I wear this top?  Is it too young for me?  Will people think I&#8217;m weird?  No, I&#8217;m too old, right?&#8221; with a sense of urgency and self-consciousness that&#8217;s a bit worrying.</p>
<p>Is this surprising at all?  I think it&#8217;s not surprising to people who aren&#8217;t my parents&#8217; children; after all, humans are incredibly flawed and we&#8217;ve got lots of dramas on Netflix that remind us of this over and over again.</p>
<p>But it <em>is</em> difficult to absorb that the sculptors of a sanctuary, that society says (through laws and media and whatnot) I&#8217;m supposed to have, don&#8217;t know that they don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re doing and have caused near-irreparable damage to themselves and to me.  &#8220;Family&#8221; is <em>supposed</em> to be where you have a group of people, usually blood-related, who accept your faults and encourage you to grow, and who are people you can open up your emotions to and get help or help others.  At least, that&#8217;s how <em>Full House</em> and <em>The Brady Bunch</em> paints it.</p>
<p>And I think that&#8217;s great, that&#8217;s really awesome, to have a private spot on Earth where you can just be yourself and not worry about the transience of that love and nurturing.  But I think people just watch these television families, fall in love with the consequences of what makes a great family great, and then build their own with paper mache and not warm flesh and blood.</p>
<p>By &#8220;consequences,&#8221; I mean the grand holidays, the exchange of gifts, the nicknames, the hugs and kisses&#8230; I mean, affection.  People crave to be loved and comforted so that they can rest and feel at peace, but they perform all these weird rituals of preparing for those events so that they <em>look</em> like they&#8217;re loved and comforted instead of actually talking to each other to <em>be</em> loved and comforted. Then people buy into these rituals so deeply that they are convinced that they are getting what they want, but are denied their true desires so that they end up feeling unsatisfied.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong; I think it&#8217;s alright to decorate the Christmas tree, to cut the Thanksgiving turkey and to go trick-or-treating.  But I can&#8217;t be misguided in thinking that we&#8217;ve begun to cheapen these holidays by only craving and interacting with the veneers of them.  Holiday creep anyone??  I think seasonal gift-giving has become something of a spectacle to distract or dispel people from their thoughts that others don&#8217;t remember or think much about them in usual day-to-day life.  It&#8217;s become a mechanical vestige of what used to result from people caring about one another.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s so weird and funny to see how everything eventually boils down to people wanted to be loved and comforted since day one (their birth).  We are all gigantic children, wearing different customs and hats to try achieve this goal.  For example, academics might use esoteric vernacular, or at the very least, more crafted and elegant diction to sound intelligent so that they are accepted in their communities.  (&lt;&#8211; See what I did there?)  Sasha Strauss, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPnhg2YolHc">in this brilliant video</a>, says that brands like Nike, Apple, etc. are basically like people begging to be loved and recognized.  They&#8217;re masked with logos and corporations but their &#8220;strategies&#8221; all aim to be adored by the masses.</p>
<p>Now, to the title of this post:  what does it mean to &#8220;grow up&#8221; (you can add the expletive in there if you want to read the question in my voice) ?   Does it mean &#8220;playing the system&#8221; to get what you want?</p>
<p><em>Does it mean recognizing this embarrassing fault in humanity?</em></p>
<p>To refer to the first point, it&#8217;s <em>not at all</em> a fault that we are creatures who need love.  I&#8217;m actually pretty sure it&#8217;s what got humans to cooperate and survive in the first place.  There&#8217;s a great concept in <em>Ex Machina</em> that&#8217;s about how sexuality plays a huge role in what makes humans, human.  A paraphrase from the movie: What would two things do with each other if they weren&#8217;t attracted to one another?  They&#8217;d probably go off on their own things and never procreate or build things together.  And then they&#8217;d eventually die.</p>
<p><em>Does it mean eschewing that childish desire to become an adult?</em></p>
<p>Reading this makes me think of a lot of villains in our books and TV shows, LOL.  Or tsunderes.  That whole, &#8220;I don&#8217;t need them!  I can be on my own!&#8221; act that I&#8217;ve gone through as a teenager.  I eventually learned in college that, actually, life is a lot easier, happier, and productive when you admit to others that you need their help and attention.  Not only do you actually get the love and comfort you need, you also find a lot of joy in fulfilling others&#8217; needs for love and comfort.  This isn&#8217;t &#8220;childish&#8221; in a derogatory sense at all!  What is &#8220;childish&#8221; about making life better and happier for everyone?</p>
<p><em>Does it mean &#8220;playing the system&#8221; to get what you want?</em></p>
<p>I feel like this is basically what politics and marketing is about, lmao.  It&#8217;s so centered on &#8220;me, me, me.&#8221;  Even if you fake empathy and kindness, if someone gets close enough to you, it will be evident that you&#8217;re doing it all for yourself.  That you are trying to get what <em>you</em> want.</p>
<p>I think ignoring what &#8220;you&#8221; want is growing  up.  I think it&#8217;s seeing that what &#8220;they&#8221; want <em>is</em> what &#8220;you&#8221; want that&#8217;s growing  up.</p>
<p>Yes, you are hungry for love and affection.  Yes, you are feeling lonely.  Yes, you have the tools to do something about it and find comfort.  But take a look at these thoughts&#8211;it&#8217;s all about you, you, you.  What about other people?  They are in pain, too, if not in <em>more</em> pain because there might actually be people out to kill and persecute them (e.g. anyone in a war-torn state).</p>
<p>There are people in pain.  <em>There are people in pain.</em>  I don&#8217;t need to explain this one, do I?!  Every news channel reminds viewers of how much pain X country is in with their revolution, how much pain Y celebrity is having with a breakup, how much pain Z person suffered through discrimination or hatred.  You know what pain feels and looks like.  In fact, you might be in pain right now.</p>
<p>But you have tools, and you are part of this huge party, or sinking ship, or whatever metaphor you want to use.  You can actually fix something.  You can actually do something.  No, you don&#8217;t need to hide under the table because someone said you should.  No, you don&#8217;t need permission to call out bullshit.  You can help!  You can help!!   And everyone, including you, will love some help!!</p>
<p>When you help out, or better yet, create opportunities for people to help out, you are loved and comforted.   Have you ever tutored someone, ever?    Have you made lunch for someone, ever?  Have you helped someone out of depression?  It&#8217;s an awesome feeling because that person knows how to smile again.  You don&#8217;t really think about yourself at that point. You might even realize that that&#8217;s all you ever really wanted.  The love and comfort is a just a bonus.  It&#8217;s the idea that you can be happy with someone else&#8217;s happiness that <em>really</em> matters.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to rely on the holiday sales, the approving smiles of our co-workers, the high grades and test scores, the slick technological gadgets, the TV show rerun binges, the pitiful reminiscing of childhood memories, the pointless one-night stands, the fake kisses and smiles, the flashy expensive clothing, the towering sculpturesque houses, the addiction to our phones and the Internet, the addiction to our drugs and caffeine, the number of loves and comments on our latest pic on our feeds, the obsessive adoration for clothing and food brands, or the disordered goals of extreme weight loss to make you happy.  Some of them are just bonuses.</p>
<p>I think realizing this is growing up.  I think realizing that our happiness is strongly affected by something as powerful as another human&#8217;s happiness, and not material, surface-level bullshit, is growing  up.  Moreover, to commit to that reality and not some delusional ideal is to grow up.  Done.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>*Really, this show deconstructs a lot of things that people idealize, like fame, love, money, intellectualism, etc.</p>
<p>**I&#8217;m not going to paint myself as a saint or anything, so here goes.  Today I went to the Apple campus store to buy a shirt, which was sort of difficult because so many colors and sizes were sold out.  So my mom verbalized her theory, &#8220;I bet that people from China are buying them in bulk to resell them at a higher price, look, look, look!&#8221;&#8211;<em>while two feet away from a Chinese man making a bulk purchase at the counter.</em>  I was sick and tired of hearing my mom make these useless, negative generalizations, so I told her on an impulse, &#8220;Mom, can you please just shut up?  I don&#8217;t understand the point you&#8217;re trying to make with those statements.&#8221;</p>
<p>Later out the store, she tried to justify to me that she was &#8220;explaining&#8221; what was happening to me and being informative.  I admonished her, saying that it was really rude for her to say that within earshot.  She said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think he heard it!  I really don&#8217;t think so!&#8221;</p>
<p>My dad brought this incident up tonight, saying that my mom was upset that I had told her to shut up.  He then added that doing such a thing was absolutely unacceptable to do to parents.  I then said&#8211;yeah, I definitely hit below the belt&#8211;&#8220;This is why you can&#8217;t find a job nowadays.  You&#8217;re so old-fashioned.  As far as I can tell, when there&#8217;s bullshit, people call out on it.  That&#8217;s how this generation works.  Every time you and Mom give me a piece of advice, I go out to the world and find that it&#8217;s about 80% wrong.  And I know it hurts, I know it does!  But that&#8217;s how it is&#8211;keep up with the times.&#8221;</p>
<p>Being honest, I&#8217;m actually not sure if telling your parents to shut up is not a &#8220;totally unacceptable&#8221; thing in my generation.  But I think it&#8217;s a necessary thing in <em>my</em> case, because I&#8217;ve tried being silent for a portion of my childhood and that didn&#8217;t work out for me.</p>
<p>***  Now that I see it, I kind of? did similar things to my parents, too.  Maybe suggesting that we not buy a fifth house is an &#8220;unwarranted comment&#8221; to them, though I think investing a couple hundred thousand dollars into a house is something that I, as an adult and eventual heir to my family&#8217;s money, have a right to comment upon.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really speak my mind as much anymore, though; I&#8217;m starting to learn that vocalizing my opinions about small things to my parents is going to cause more harm than good for either of us.  But I do mention big things, such as my parents&#8217; fixation on money and their inability to have a conversation that isn&#8217;t about money.  They defend their views, saying that &#8220;everything is money.&#8221;</p>
