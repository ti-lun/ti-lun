        <title>Finally Finished!!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Holy crap, I finally have my own little home on the Internet!  I’ve built lots of websites in the past, but none with so much effort as this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many languages to assemble together this with Jekyll.  Along with HTML/CSS (which was expected), there was some impromptu YAML, Liquid, and Markdown language learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some sacrifices had to be made!  Agh.  Originally, “katiebui.com” was supposed to direct the user to the portfolio.  But I was using GitHub pages to host my website, and Jekyll forces me to host its file in my root directory.&lt;/p&gt;
