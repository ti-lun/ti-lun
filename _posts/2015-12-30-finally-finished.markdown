Holy crap, I finally have my own little home on the Internet!  I've built lots of websites in the past, but none with so much effort as this one. 

So many languages to assemble together this with Jekyll.  Along with HTML/CSS (which was expected), there was some impromptu YAML, Liquid, and Markdown language learning.

Some sacrifices had to be made!  Agh.  Originally, "katiebui.com" was supposed to direct the user to the portfolio.  But I was using GitHub pages to host my website, and Jekyll forces me to host its file in my root directory.
