  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>About a month or two ago, there was this post in a Facebook group that asked its members if they wanted to be beta testers for their new subscription service, Duckvan.  It’s basically a strong, challenging dose of exoticism, or as Duckvan puts it on their website, “your monthly box of WTF.”
<br /><br /></p>

<p>Prior to ever coming across this concept, I’ve always been a bit of an adventurous eater, so I definitely was pumped when I got the package in the mail!  My boyfriend, who doesn’t stray far from the usual American fare, was dragged along with taste-testing everything out.
<br /><br /></p>

<h2>Packaging</h2>

<center>&lt;img src="http://katiebui.com/assets/duckvan/01.jpg" width=500&gt;</center>

<p>Some initial reactions:<br /></p>
<ul>
    <li>"Wow, clean lines and fresh colors.  Nice."</li>
    <li>"It's also kind of speckle-y... I suppose the printing process wasn't too solid.</li>
    <li>"What a cute icon, lol."</li>
</ul>

<p>"Fresh" is the word that comes to mind when I look at the packaging.  The light blue, playful yellow and white sans-serif font motif going on makes me feel kind of excited to venture into some weird food territory.  It lends a sort of safe, yet energetic mood for what I'm about to experiment with.</p>

<p>After figuring out how to open the thing--it's one of those tapeless, folded cardboard boxes that adds a second or two in the unboxing process--here it is!</p>

<center>&lt;img src="http://katiebui.com/assets/duckvan/02.jpg" width=500&gt;</center>

<p>Haha, the green shredded stuff looks like grass.  My boyfriend asked, "Are those dollar bills?!"  Indeed, it looked like shredded dollar bills, but I'm pretty sure they're not.  They don't feel or smell like them.</p>

<p>I am pretty glad this was included.</p>

<center>&lt;img src="http://katiebui.com/assets/duckvan/04.jpg" width=500&gt;</center>

<p>It's nice to know what you're eating.  I loved reading the blurbs; they do a pretty good job of building the anticipatory tension that goes with eating this stuff.  At the same time, I think it <em>really</em> seems to target already-adventurous eaters.  Only an idiot like me would find ingredients for hand grenades and welding steel suitable for putting into my body.</p>

<p>So I've actually had almost everything on the list, except for the Salsaghetti.  I was actually kind of scared of eating that one, LOL.  It reminds me of the packaging of really cheap snacks in convenience stores that usually tasted like crap.  For perspective, I'm including my boyfriend's thoughts on these things, too.</p>

<center>&lt;img src="http://katiebui.com/assets/duckvan/045.jpg" width=250&gt;&lt;img src="http://katiebui.com/assets/duckvan/05.jpg" width=250&gt;</center>

<h2>The food</h2>
<p>Alright, let's dig in.  First up is the ghost pepper popcorn.</p>

<h3>Ghost Pepper Popcorn</h3>

<center><img src="http://katiebui.com/assets/duckvan/10.jpg" /></center>

<p>Upon microwaving this throat-killer, the bag popped like any other microwaved popcorn and even smelled like it too.  The main difference came when actually inhaling the odor of the ghost pepper popcorn--it <em>hurt</em>.  Like, it literally stung my throat to just sniff the thing.</p>

<p>My boyfriend's friends also happened to be over and we decided to prank him.</p>

<blockquote>
BF: Hey, want some popcorn?
<br />
Friend: (Pause) Sure...
<br /><em>Takes fistfull of popcorn and eats it</em>
<br />
Friend:  Alright, what'd you do to it?
</blockquote>

<p>Eventually, the poor guy had to be rushed over to the kitchen to douse his mouth with water.  For the next hour or so, everybody was coughing because the spiciness of the pepper permeated the entire apartment... Haha, we had to open all the doors and turn on the AC for about an hour.</p>

<p>The whole bag still hasn't been finished; it's just so spicy.  I gained some masochistic pleasure from eating it though.  My boyfriend's Indian roommate on the other hand: "Just needs more butter."

<h3>Wasabi Kit-Kat</h3>

<p>I was personally disappointed; it didn't have any wasabi taste.  My boyfriend's thought: "Oh good, it tastes normal!"  I did have a wasabi kit kat before, though, and it *did* taste like wasabi.  Not sure why these kit kats ended up tasting like milk-flavored kat kats.</p>

<h3>Salmiakki</h3>

<p>I've had very strong Swedish licorice before and I liked it, so I was mostly looking forward to my boyfriend's reactions, hahaha.  I can confirm that this licorice was the real deal--super salty, alkaline, and packed with its signature anise flavor.  The softer variant might be better on the teeth, I think.</p>

<p>My boyfriend wasn't a huge fan of this one.  The al-dente chewiness lingered for too long for him to like it.</p>

<h3>Durian candy</h3>

<p>Growing up in a Vietnamese family, I was no stranger to durian.  In fact it's actually my favorite fruit!  So when I unwrapped the candy and popped it into my mouth, I was vaulted into my land of childhood memories.  Surprisingly my boyfriend actually enjoyed it; I'd totally crack open a real durian for him to try one day.  :p</p>

<h3>Salsaghetti</h3>

<p>Honestly, this was the only candy that took me out of my comfort zone, so I took a couple of photos for this.  I mean... it's stringified gummy fruit stuff with <em>sauce</em>.  Sauce?!  And it was meant to be emulate the spaghetti-eating experience, which should taste neither fruity nor gummy nor spicy.  Oh lord.  Well, here we go.</p>

<center><img src="http://katiebui.com/assets/duckvan/07.jpg" /></center>

<p>I felt like a kid again opening a mini Lunchables box, what with that tiny yellow packet to rip open and smother onto my food.  Except the difference is that the food itself looks like (a) brains or (b) ground red meat.  Too bad it didn't come with a small plastic fork, though!  I had to grab a fork to spread the thing around (because lord knows I am not eating that with my fingers.)</p>

<center><img src="http://katiebui.com/assets/duckvan/08.jpg" /><br /><em>Awww yeah.</em><br /><br /><img src="http://katiebui.com/assets/duckvan/09.jpg" /></center>

<p><strong>POWERFUL.</strong>  Wow, this was kind of like eating a watermelon-flavored spicy Warheads candy!!  The sauce added a sharp sourness to the spicy crystals embedded in the noodles.  The noodles themselves overpowered my tastebuds with Jolly-Rancheresque, artificial watermelon-y and saccharine waves of flavor.  We ended up liking it (me moreso than him), but WOW.  What an explosive way to scarf down 70 calories.</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>

<p>Since the salsaghetti was, surprisingly, a novel experience that turned out well for me, I'd say eating that was the most Duckvannish experience I was given.  The boyfriend liked the popcorn the most because it was "fun" (???).</p>

<p>I would have to say that Duckvan has a way to go for determining its target audience.  While they proclaim on their website that they're "not for beginners," they should realize that the adventurous veterans like me have likely tried the snacks that they'd be sending.  I definitely had fun sharing my experiences with friends who hadn't tried them, though, so perhaps that's a good place to start from marketing-wise.</p>

<p>I thank the Duckvan team for sending me this epic and hilarious box of fun over to Irvine, and I really hope y'all do a great job on your release!!  :)</p>
