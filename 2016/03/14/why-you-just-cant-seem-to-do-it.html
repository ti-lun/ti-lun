    <p>Underneath my bed are a pair of Nike shoes, and in my drawer are some Nike running shorts with a Nike sports bra.  You’d think that my attraction to this brand has to do with my values–“just do it”–being parallel to how they market themselves, but I think it’s something a bit more subtle: I want my values to be parallel to that powerful little aphorism.</p>

<p>How would I know if my values actually are in line with Nike’s?  In the Nike commercials they portray athletes running into things (the water, the track, the soccer field), getting tired, and winning things.  More often than not, they are people who have already achieved greatness.  If you go to Nike’s website, their models have bodies that, err, embody the signs of greatness that they hold to the light.  Their sculpted abs, fierce gazes, and statuesque action poses are visible and visceral signs of progress that appear regardless of who is watching, giving feedback or cheering from the sidelines.  So maybe I’d know if greatness has been achieved if I’ve struggled, pushed through, and grown some muscles.  That’s how I’d know if I’ve “just done it.”</p>

<p>Then why won’t I do the things I said I’d do?  Why won’t I dig into that open-source project, why won’t I take up hip hop dance lessons again, why won’t I call up that one friend whom I haven’t seen since high school, why won’t I learn that new language, why won’t I study for my finals like I should be doing right now?</p>

<p>Daniel Pink’s Drive, Charles Duhigg’s The Power of Habit, and Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers say that I’ve basically got all the psychological, biological and practical resources to do the shit I said I was gonna do: a supportive community (going to a university), a healthy mind and body, and internet access to basically the collective human knowledge of the world.  So why aren’t I just doing it?</p>

<p>You see, I think the “it” part of “just do it” is worthy of discussion.  The “do”-ing part seems to be pretty simple; you can probably condense the physical actions needed to actually do any of my current goals listed about into a recipe-like list of directions.  The “it” part is kind of ambiguous: what does “digging into that open-source project” even mean to me?  What does “calling up a friend” mean?</p>

<p>Our minds will readily supply the answer.  “Well, Katie, go Google ‘open-source development’ and go see for yourself!”  or “It means Facebook messaging them with some sort of friendly ‘Long time no see’ greeting and then inviting them to have a coffee.”</p>

<p>And then our bodies will have usually some sort of funky reaction to that.  For me, I get this feeling like a pristine, white sheet of paper has been crumpled up in my chest.  I get cringe-y.  I also get this angel-demon hybrid that pops up on my shoulder that says, “Ah, but if you don’t, you’re a coward.”</p>

<p>After that quick little reaction, I do one of three things: I do it to its completion (about 10% of the time), I attempt doing it and then drop it within ten minutes (about 40% of the time) or I open up a tab to ebay.com or fanfiction, thinking that I might as well enjoy myself a bit before embarking on doing the first option, and then end up doing something else completely different (about 50% of the time).</p>

<p>So you might think, “Ah, perhaps this post is about increasing that 10% of the time she actually executes her vision, and how I might be able to.”  No, actually–I’m writing about vision is.</p>

<p>Here’s how I, and many people of my generation, have lived life so far, in two different versions.</p>
<blockquote>
I was born in the 90s in San Jose, CA, in the heart of Silicon Valley.  My dad was an engineer, my mom a nurse, and we are a pretty wealthy family.  I'd like to keep life that way, especially in such an awesome, dynamic place like the Bay Area, so I really don't see why I shouldn't try to aim for a job at Google or Apple.  I mean, I can do it--I know what it's like to grind at something to get what I've wanted, whether it be a super tough boss battle in a video game, an A, saving up for my phone, whatever.  After all, I'd be doing important work with my major, so I think that's good for my life.  And I'd get a nice 6-figure salary and meet well-informed, ambitious people like me whom I could build my life around.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
I was born.  Then my parents took care of me.  Had some good times, had some bad, but for the most part I took for granted my good times, and only oversaw the bad times without dealing directly with the mess itself (e.g. being the recipient/victim of a layoff, lawsuit, divorce, or crime).  A lot of people said that doing X was good, so I did that, because there didn't seem to be a reason to do the other way.  There are many ways to go about doing X (i.e. getting a high-paying job, a stable life with a house and family, accomplishing good work in my community) and they all are theoretically sound.  I spend a lot of time trying to do X and other good things that are related to X.
</blockquote>

<p>What’s the difference?  The first sounds like an animated narrative, like a breath of humanity has been blown onto it.  The second sounds more detached, even Stoic.  Both of these are “right” in their own ways.</p>

<p>The first is a story that we usually tell ourselves.  It’s our natural caffeine, our motivations and logical tactics for us to envelop ourselves in a world where there’s shit to be done, there’s problems to solve, and our existence has a purpose in this huge machine we’re all born into.  There’s an almost video-gamish aspect to it: choose your calling, choose the skills you’ll hone, choose the quests to fulfill and then gather companionship with your fellow players.  Hey, video games are fun.  It’s fun to think of life this way and it’s easier to.</p>

<p>The second isn’t really a story; it’s more like a sequence of events that our bodies have actually lived and experience.  While it seems really simplified, that is likely how our bodies interpret our lives.  It doesn’t particularly recall certain moments in the past and cherish them in the way our minds do because it lives in the sliver-thin moments of present time.  And each of those moments I was living my awesome plans in my head, I was making my body (well, myself) suffer through doing coding assignments at 4 am, going to club meetings half-asleep, meeting friends in the middle of midterms and cutting the time short because we’re both so goddamn busy, and somehow getting up every morning in dedication to these voices in my head telling me I should just keep doing “it.”</p>

<p>Finally, we arrive to trying to answer the question, “What is this ‘it’?”  Where did I get the idea that I should ever accomplish these “it”s?</p>

<p>Of course, I approved and agreed to these goals and plans.  They are good for my life.  Why wouldn’t I trust the myriad of experts whose articles I’ve been reading, or my classmates who are smarter than me, or even my own eyes of seeing what it’s like having money, being surrounded by certain people, doing certain kinds of work?  Yo, it’s difficult to say that my half-sister, who now makes probably $200K+ in a biomedical device company and spends time Yelping with her sharp-minded and fun-loving friends and co-workers, isn’t living a good life.  Hey, I want a good life, too.</p>

<p>There’s this movie named Surrogate about a society where people have robots live their lives out for them.  While it’s kind of ridiculous and not even a really good movie, our society is already sort of like that.  We have all these digital and made up representations of what our lives could be, these virtual carrots raining down in our visions, and we are trained to think that getting these carrots is a way of validating ourselves and living our lives.
The only difference lies in who does the execution: in the movie, there are cold, metallic contraptions doing so, in real life, there are cold hearts–once warm and alive–mechanically doing the work that other people keep telling us to do.  And the real persons in ourselves are sitting back, hoping to reap the joys that were promised to us.</p>

<p>So when we hear “just do it,” who is the one doing it?  Is it our minds, sitting up in their high chairs?  Or is it our bodies, the actual vehicles of bone and flesh that type the code, that stay up during the late nights, that glue their eyes to the books, that anchor themselves to chairs for ten or so hours a day despite not having been sculpted by evolution to do so?  And now our minds have even more plans that need to be realized, which need more nights of staying up, more professors to please, more employers to reach out to, more hours of work.</p>

<p>Sometimes we end up doing it anyway because we begin hating ourselves if we don’t.  We call ourselves names that other people have called us or called others when they don’t behave the way they want.  My demons call me a coward, they say that I’m weak, they threaten to drag the rest of my life down if I don’t do X–not for them of course, but for “my own benefit.”</p>

<p>Well.  No wonder I didn’t “just do it.”  I–truly, I–never really had wanted to.  I’ve been so out of touch with what I actually want.  No one taught me fucking ask myself and indulge.  And don’t get me wrong, I don’t just want to lay around all day eating potato chips and having sex.  I need a rest.  And I need to figure out what I actually want, which is one thing that no one, or no school, or no inspirational speaker has ever taught me.</p>

<p>That’s because the answers are inside of me or, with enough experiences and painful lessons, they will be inside me.  I can help figure out these answers by seeing how others did for themselves, i.e. reading the biographies of great people who managed to blend their desires and goals into one.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if “just do it” is still a good motto to have for me.  Maybe it works once I find those “it”s.  And I will, because I know I’m brave enough to ask myself what they are.</p>
