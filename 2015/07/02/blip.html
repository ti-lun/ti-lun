    <p>&#8220;Blip&#8221; is a funny word.  It was the first word that popped into my head when I registered that I had to put in a title for this post.  It sounds like an onomatopoeia that describes its meaning, a sound that, for a tiny interval of time, pierces the air.</p>

<p>Which is what I want this current struggle in me to be like.  Go away soon, please!  It&#8217;s weird that I&#8217;m back to where I was in the beginning of last year, except that I know a lot more now.  Now I&#8217;ve got a bird&#8217;s eye view of what I was struggling with the entire year: values!  Just knowing that has been 90% of the battle.  To be more precise, I was struggling with figuring out what values to adopt.  I was experimenting with many aspects of my life to the extremes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lots of work (5 hrs/day) vs. nearly no work (3 hrs/week)</li>
<li>Being unsocial (just in the dorm room all the time) vs. being social (scheduling lots of hangouts)</li>
<li>Being very logical vs. being very emotional</li>
<li>Being uncommitted (no club activities) vs. throwing everything I&#8217;ve got into a group (TEDxUCIrvine)</li>
<li>Eating healthily vs. eating unhealthily</li>
<li>Lots of exercise (nearly 5 mi/day) vs. no exercise</li>
<li>Lots of math/science vs. lots of art/humanities</li>
<li>Lots of money vs. scraping by</li>
<li>Lots of following directions (teamwork, classwork) vs. lots of inventive creativity (art, idea-making)</li>
</ul>
<p>Near the end of the school year, my values started to break down.  I was, subconsciously, trying replacing them with new ones.  And it&#8217;s a painful process because there&#8217;s that little moment when you feel like you aren&#8217;t doing anything and you don&#8217;t believe in anything and you&#8217;re a blank slate!</p>
<p>Every day during this summer so far, I&#8217;ve felt this tension in my chest that I&#8217;m a nobody right now, that I&#8217;ve yet to become useful because I haven&#8217;t been &#8220;born&#8221; yet.  I want to go out and do things.  But I&#8217;m not even sure what things I want to do, let alone &#8220;supposed&#8221; to do.  For once in my life, I&#8217;ve had to find out what I want; I&#8217;ve had to educate myself <em>how</em> to want&#8211;a thing no one can tell you about.</p>
<p>Sometimes something that would usually be perceived as &#8220;bad&#8221; would happen to me and I wouldn&#8217;t feel anything.  Those moments make me happy and scared at the same time.  I&#8217;m changing and it&#8217;s possible to change my values (hooray).  On the other hand, where&#8217;s the limit to which I can be complacent and okay with things?  I get scared that I forgot how to have emotions and care about things, to have a passion for something I&#8217;d be willing to fight and die for.</p>
<p>So I get thrilled sometimes when I unexpectedly leap into a tirade or cry or feel sweet joy.  There <em>is</em> some soul within me that isn&#8217;t indifferent to everything.  What usually triggers me are family, friends, how other people emote, etc.  For instance, memories of going to Great America in middle school still light up my heart.  And oddly enough, the pride I get from accomplishing an ICS project is quick and temporary, even if it&#8217;s something that signifies how good I am at something.</p>
<p>I think my &#8220;soul&#8221; reacting and emoting to things is a rudiment of values, perhaps passed down genetically or evolutionarily.  And in response to the world I live in, I develop &#8220;internal values&#8221; that I can&#8217;t even understand or seek out yet.</p>
<hr />

<p>Lately I&#8217;ve been just living.  I feel these little moments of perceiving these subtle layers of what it&#8217;s like to live that goes beyond what words and images can explain&#8230; it&#8217;s those moments that vibrate in your bones, that feeling that is behind the urge to compel.  I also feel the itch to &#8220;do something more,&#8221; to fulfill my &#8220;potential,&#8221; to not just sit around and enjoy my life.</p>
<p>Ever since that talk I had with Kevin, I realized that I&#8217;ve been enjoying my life too little.  In high school and the past two years I&#8217;ve felt some strange need to be pressurized all the time, to get things done.  That might be in the form of grades, being &#8220;sufficiently social,&#8221; creating enough artwork, and more.  To relax felt sinful.  To some expect, to not punish myself for relaxing was sinful, too.</p>
<p>When I look back at my blog entries from middle school, though, it seems in those days I was content with &#8220;just living.&#8221;  I gleefully recalled, with great detail, everything that happened to me that day, down to line-by-line dialogue of people I wasn&#8217;t even friends with.  All I talked about was stuff that happened to me, getting better at drawing, stuff I coveted, and my emotions towards people (especially frustration).  I wasn&#8217;t obsessed with mastering academic things, nor was I really confused about who I was.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what happened but somewhere along the way in high school, I became very paranoid and anxious about everything&#8230; perhaps the influence of my mom.  Perhaps it was the friends I hung out with, a generational thing.  Or, you know, all of that combined.  (I&#8217;m looking through my entries in my old livejournal.  <a href="http://misatotown.livejournal.com/2010/04/23/">Here</a>&#8216;s where a noticeable change in my personality/writing happened.  I still wrote with lots of emoticons in later entries, though.  <a href="http://misatotown.livejournal.com/2011/11/16/">This</a> is another interesting post on work and values.)  I was also pretty precocious and self-aware for my age, though that fucked me over socially <span class="wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-tongue" title=":P">:P</span></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been better at keeping myself sane lately.  I don&#8217;t get as paranoid over things anymore.  Even when I &#8220;try&#8221; to, I think to myself, &#8220;No wait&#8211;this looks too different.  There&#8217;s a lot of nuances that differentiate this experience from the last.&#8221;  Or, I might tell myself, &#8220;No, that took place a couple of weeks ago.  This looks the same, but it&#8217;s actually different.  Things loop; that&#8217;s normal.&#8221;  Hooray!</p>

<p>I should write and read my writings more.  I should read more in general&#8230; I can see that I&#8217;m trying to avoid reality by reading lots of fanfiction.</p>
