        <title>2016 Resolutions</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Haha, everytime I write New Year’s resolutions, I can’t find where I put it a year later so that I could reflect upon it.  Since I’ve gone to such lengths to set up this blog, hopefully it’ll be nested comfortably in permanence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;This Year&#39;s Resolutions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think to make them actually doable and trackable, I should make the resulting habits or goals concrete.  Most if not all of these goals are about routinization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Eating processed sweets only once every three days&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	This problem&#39;s bad enough to warrant its own tier, lol. It&#39;s not even in a cute way, like how L from Death Note childishly eats strawberries and eclairs. Lots of money goes wasted from tossing out actual, healthy food that ends up rotting in the fridge because I&#39;d end up replacing meals with sugary cereal or cookies (sob).  An exception I&#39;m going to make, though, is fruit.  It&#39;s got vitamins and fiber!
	&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;To&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; verb &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; noun &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; time frame&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;To read a book a month&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;To cook homemade food every other day&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;To tidy up my room every Sunday&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;To do an algorithm problem every day&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;To write something, digitally or on paper, every day&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;To work on ONE personal project every day&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;To watch a whole TV/anime series (up to 50 episodes) every break&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;To beat a video game every quarter&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;To go outside every day&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;To do something &lt;i&gt;entirely for no reason&lt;/i&gt; every day&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		I&#39;m sure there&#39;s going to be more added to this at some point.
	&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Controlling my compulsiveness&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	It was not until just a couple weeks ago I realized that I tend to be pretty compulsive.  While it&#39;s done some pretty good things for me in the past--a great three-day trip to L.A. to see a concert the week before finals, for example--it&#39;s also caused me quite a bit of damage in the long-run.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;An example is buying things.  As I was growing up, my mother was (and still is) very compulsive about making huge, luxurious purchases (like buying a pair of $1500 shoes she didn&#39;t even like).  I thought it was normal, until I faced the challenges of carrying that poor habit to college.  After whittling my budget down to subsisting on rice and soy sauce a couple of times, I finally got my crap together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;What I&#39;m struggling with now is health.  I mentioned my sweet tooth above; I have an compulsiveness to substitute sweets for healthy food.  Worse yet, I love eating a lot of finger foods at once.  Man, those days where I had a giant bag of Rold Gold thins for all my meals...  What I&#39;m going to do is time myself as I&#39;m eating something.  If I&#39;m eating cereal, for instance, I have to choose a brand where the pieces are reasonably large, and then time myself to eat one piece/minute. &lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;I also find it difficult right now to focus doing just &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; thing for more than ten or fifteen minutes, unless I&#39;m relentlessly crazy about it.  In other words, I want to routinize my workflow, since it sort of resembles a fireworks show rather than the consistent glow of the sun.  The easiest way to go about this is probably to just catch myself being super unfocused or being super intense, and then correct it.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;To feel other people&#39;s emotions more strongly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	After playing an awesome game called &lt;i&gt;Undertale&lt;/i&gt;, I realized that much of people&#39;s troubles stem from the inability to relate and communciate correctly.  As for me, I&#39;m an intensely emotional person... but mostly for things that occur in my life.  That extent of emotional-ness doesn&#39;t need to concern everybody in the world, but I do want to be able to care very deeply about others.  So what I want to do is pray for someone (not necessarily anyone I know) every day.  Maybe I could go further with this later.
	&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Make learning technical stuff as seamless as possible&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	It takes a lot of energy and mind-bending to understand code.  Really, I think it all comes down to being comfortable with understanding how stuff fits and works together--mechanics, and why that stuff could be expanded to other stuff that doesn&#39;t exist yet--design (maybe mathematics).
	&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	So every day, these are some activities that could be done to help out with that kind of thinking:
	&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Drawing something, like cars or buildings or cats, from every perspective (front, back, 3/4, skewed angles, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Reading and sketching how everyday objects operate (e.g. how does a toaster work?&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Straight-up doing algorithms&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Assembling stuff together, like sewing clothing&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, I think five for now is pretty good.  :)
Good luck to everyone this year!  I hope everyone achieves what they set out to do.  As Shia LaBouf says, “Don’t let your dreams be dreams.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hurray, finished!! + Fixing Jekyll Problems</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Holy crap, I finally have my own little home on the Internet!  I’ve built lots of websites in the past, but none with so much effort as this one.  My bed mattress probably has a dent in it from me having laid on it for like, two days straight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many languages to assemble together this with Jekyll.  Along with HTML/CSS and JavaScript (which was expected), there was some impromptu YAML, Liquid, and Markdown language learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building Jekyll took about 50% the time and 80% the frustration.  Poor documentation made building Jekyll on GitHub Pages &lt;i&gt;way&lt;/i&gt; harder than it needed to be!!  Argh.  For the soul out there that landed here through Google, here are some fixes I had to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Jekyll must run on the root directory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks can deceive… this blog ran a-okay on a subdirectory under my local GitHub repository, but failed to build when pushed to GitHub.  I had my website configured like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;portfolio
|___ index.html 		(of portfolio)
|___ ... 				(other files pertaining to portfolio)
|___ ...
|___ ...
|___ jekyll blog
        |___ index.html (of blog)
        |___ ...
        |___ ...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out that in the _configure.yml file, GitHub Pages overrides whatever source directory you set it up as.  Then when it attempts to build your site, it will begin looking for subdirections in the &lt;em&gt;root&lt;/em&gt; directory rather than from where your jekyll subdirectory is.  In my case, it was trying to find _includes.  I got this email from GitHub:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The page build failed with the following error:

A file was included in `kb-blog/index.html` that is a symlink or does not exist in your `_includes` directory. For more information, see https://help.github.com/articles/page-build-failed-file-is-a-symlink.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What I had to do&lt;/b&gt; was make the jekyll blog’s subdirectory’s files at the same level as the portfolio’s.  So it would be organized this way instead:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;jekyll blog
|___ journal.html       (of blog)
|___ ...                (other files pertaining to blog)
|___ ...
|___ ...
|___ index.html         (of portfolio)
|___ ...                (other files pertaining to portfolio)
|___ ...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is messy and disorganized, I know!  See the next point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;DNS servers only point to baseurls&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had once tried to make the structure of the website look more like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;jekyll blog
|___ index.html         (of blog)
|___ ...
|___ ...
|___ portfolio
    |___ index.html (of portfolio)
    |___ ...
    |___ ...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I wanted katiebui.com to point to the index of my portfolio, not my blog.  (In other words, katiebui.com -&amp;gt; ti-lun.github.io/portfolio/index.html.)  As much as I like to write and stuff, it’s not like I’m featuring top-notch content here yet :’D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What I had to do&lt;/b&gt; was organize the website like the way I had it in the first diagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Jekyll has no tagging system.. or, at least, a readily apparent one&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy, right?  I just followed &lt;a href=&quot;http://vrepin.org/vr/Tagging/&quot; target=&quot;&quot;&gt;this tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.  It was just adding a Ruby plugin to generate a page for each tag, and then creating a page that aggregated all the blog’s tags using Liquid.  Yet there was a wrinkle here…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;GitHub Pages doesn&#39;t support Ruby plugins&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, figuring out that &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; was the issue involved an hour or two of confusion and testing of will.  The problem manifested into this really odd paranoia of, “Why aren’t the tag pages being generated?!”  After all, the locally-generated Jekyll blog was working perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here were some symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;My GitHub showed that the Jekyll blog&#39;s _site subdirectory was uploaded, along with the tag subdirectory (its child).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;None of the tag folder&#39;s subdirectories were accessible in the address bar.  (The tag folder holds all of the tags and their individual tag pages.)  So, if I try to type in katiebui.com/tag/college, I would get a 404 error.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The tag page generator&#39;s script &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; have been working fine, since it was able to generate pages in the local build.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It couldn&#39;t be a DNS problem because the 404 error was from GitHub, which means the DNS server pointed to the right guy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I finally realized the issue (Ruby plugins aren’t supported), I had the urge to abandon all the fixes I had made and to just get a more flexible webhost than GitHub Pages.  But I fought on when I realized I’d be taking out ~$40/year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What I had to do&lt;/b&gt; was create a directory &lt;i&gt;outside&lt;/i&gt; my GitHub repository’s local directory, and create a script that copied generated files built in the former directory into the latter directory.  (Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sitepoint.com/jekyll-plugins-github/&quot;&gt;this tutorial&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I arranged my website to be like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;website
    |___ everything-master
	    |___ index.html
	    |___ journal.html
	    |___ ...
    |___ ti-lun.github.io
	    |___ anything that everything-master generates
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I placed a Rakefile in everything-master that basically builds everything needed, then empties my local GitHub repository, and then copies stuff from everything-master into it.  Git add, commit and push and huzzah I’m done!… right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Still some problems, but not Jekyll-related&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something that I’ve noticed is that my domain, katiebui.com, is down at seemingly-random times.  I’d have to manually go to GoDaddy.com and reconnect my domain to my GitHub Pages website, which is annoying especially in the early development phase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suspect that it has to do with DNS stuff.  I don’t know exactly how it works, though… (sigh)  Time to either call GoDaddy, or do some experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, I think I’ve gained confidence in using my resources (i.e. other people’s stuff) and finding ways to use them (i.e. other people’s advice and experience).  Most of all… I think I learned that reading documentation and restraining my momentary impatience would have saved me quite a bit of trouble, hahaha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update!&lt;/b&gt;  I called GoDaddy; they said I didn’t delete the A record of their default parked page, LOL.  Works great now.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Growing Up -- An Essay about the Construction of &quot;Family&quot;</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has known me long enough knows that my parents and I really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;, don&amp;#8217;t get along&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;  Anyone who&amp;#8217;s been with me since high school knows for sure that in particular, my relationship with my psychotic mother is the cause of a lot of problems that our family has had, and I have lacked a lot of &amp;#8220;normal experiences&amp;#8221; that other children had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Psychotic&amp;#8221;?  &lt;em&gt;Katie, that&amp;#8217;s a bit extreme, isn&amp;#8217;t it?&lt;/em&gt;  No, I really do mean &amp;#8220;psychotic&amp;#8221; in the sense that my mother has these delusions of what life is like and overreacts emotionally to these delusions.  For instance: my dad tells my mom, &amp;#8220;Hey, wait!!  Close the door, close the door, you&amp;#8217;re letting all the cold air in!!&amp;#8221;&amp;#8211;and suddenly my mom believes that she&amp;#8217;s being persecuted and abused.  Having grown up in her cage and having escaped it, I can safely say that my mother is mentally ill in some manner and is toxic for the people she&amp;#8217;s living with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike a lot of my past blog posts (bosts?  lol), I&amp;#8217;m not going to give a lengthy, detailed account of my Thanksgiving break just to prove a singular point: my &amp;#8220;family&amp;#8221; is shitty.  Instead, I&amp;#8217;m going to give a voice to the thought that&amp;#8217;s been lingering in my head, meant to rouse me from the rut that I&amp;#8217;ve fallen in for past couple of weeks: &lt;strong&gt;grow up&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;more-272&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had just finished watching &lt;em&gt;Bojack Horseman&lt;/em&gt;, a great cartoon that thinly veils strong criticism and commentary on American society with stoner humor and black humor.  If you haven&amp;#8217;t watched it yet and you don&amp;#8217;t give two shits about propriety, you&amp;#8217;ve gotta watch this show!  The premise is that a washed-up middle-aged actor, eponymous of the show, struggles to deal with his self-esteem after starring in a popular 90&amp;#8217;s family sitcom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout some of the episodes, the concept of &amp;#8220;family&amp;#8221; is challenged and morphed by the characters in the show.  There&amp;#8217;s the&amp;#8221;family&amp;#8221; in the sitcom that Bojack and other characters created, made of a surrogate father and three orphans.  There&amp;#8217;s the &amp;#8220;family&amp;#8221; that the director of the sitcom, Herb Kazzaz, told the cast to maintain even outside of the show, if only because showbiz is hard.  There&amp;#8217;s Charlotte&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;family&amp;#8221; that looks great on the outside, but is threatened by Bojack&amp;#8217;s presence; Charlotte finds herself more attracted to Bojack than her husband, and Charlotte&amp;#8217;s daughter finds herself attracted to having sex with Bojack because she finds herself treated like a child with everyone else (especially her &amp;#8220;family&amp;#8221;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these examples show that a lot of people try to &amp;#8220;play house,&amp;#8221; try to construct a pretty family, and try to put the pieces together so that their ideal thing of &amp;#8220;family&amp;#8221; is accomplished.*  I really do mean the word &amp;#8220;construct&amp;#8221; because there&amp;#8217;s definitely artifice here.  The funny thing is, &lt;em&gt;so many people&lt;/em&gt; try so hard to construct a family.  Eventually they dedicate so much of their lives to it that it&amp;#8217;s all they really have in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My parents and I fight every time I come home for the holidays.  It amazes me that this time around, I didn&amp;#8217;t cry on the first two days of getting back (I did a little bit on the third).  But it amazes me &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; that, for some reason, we keep investing hundreds of dollars to fly me home for the holidays.  On one day we have an argument; the next we&amp;#8217;re discussing airline flights back to San Jose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after my mom burst in the door to angrily yell at me having not packed up yet, to instigate a debate, and to leave everyone in a sour mood, I realized that there was &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; to come back home for.  For one, it makes answering to people who ask, &amp;#8220;How was your holiday?&amp;#8221; &lt;em&gt;really awkward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In seriousness, though, the internet connection here is awful, I eat vegan so it&amp;#8217;s not like I&amp;#8217;m coming home to &amp;#8220;Mom&amp;#8217;s cooking,&amp;#8221; my parents have no hobbies and are incapable of holding a conversation that isn&amp;#8217;t about money with me, and we disagree on enough things that we get riled up about it.**&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told my dad to get a refund for the tickets back home during Christmas.  Judging from his reaction, I think he didn&amp;#8217;t take me seriously at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me:  Hey, can you get a refund for the tickets back home?  I&amp;#8217;ve got a place to stay for winter break, so there&amp;#8217;s no need to worry about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad:  Well, ha, but it&amp;#8217;s winter vacation.  You might as well go back home, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me:  Haha, Dad, being here is no &amp;#8220;vacation.&amp;#8221;  Trust me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dad:  But you come back for family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me:  You guys&amp;#8230; you guys try &lt;em&gt;so hard&lt;/em&gt; to uphold this thing you keep calling a &amp;#8220;family.&amp;#8221;  Show it to me.  Where is it?  What kind of family is like this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230; Then my dad goes off into complaining about my mom&amp;#8217;s neurosis and tendency to blow up at any little thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things that happen in my family suddenly make a lot of sense to me now.  I mean, I knew it earlier, but now I see it clearly enough to be a rotating gear, a mechanical force that has been churning away long enough to be traceable and understandable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My parents are an extreme version of the American dream.  (&amp;#8220;Extreme American dream.&amp;#8221;  lol.)  They came from Vietnam with little, worked their tails off to buy five houses, sent their kid to college without government loans, drove dream cars, wore overpriced jewelry that could have paid for my college expenses anyway, and ate gigantic, expensive meals of tiny courses.  I think the pinnacle of this is when my mom bought &lt;a href=&quot;http://s4.postimg.org/uzb70k0ql/Photo_by_Bengt_Enrique.jpg&quot;&gt;these shoes&lt;/a&gt; for about $1200 and never, ever wore them.  When I asked why she bought them, she said, &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t know!  I just had so much money to spend!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet they are pretty unhappy and irritable.  I know this, because they&amp;#8217;re in their late 50&amp;#8217;s/early 60&amp;#8217;s (not that old) and yet they&amp;#8217;re blaming everything on their age, and blaming everything on their bosses, on their children, on lawyers, on everyone except themselves.  And many notions of change or individuality either provoke some unwarranted comment from them&amp;#8211;today I wore a snood and my dad said pointedly, &amp;#8220;That&amp;#8217;s way too thick for your neck&amp;#8221; with a grimace&amp;#8211;or sends them into a rage because they&amp;#8217;ve been bottling up their insecurities.  Last &amp;#8220;break,&amp;#8221; I told my mom that we shouldn&amp;#8217;t buy a fifth house because we&amp;#8217;re already very deep in debt and she began screaming and accusing me of questioning her authority and leadership in the family.***&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they are insecure.  My mom, who looks pretty good for her age, still asks me, &amp;#8220;Is it okay if I wear this top?  Is it too young for me?  Will people think I&amp;#8217;m weird?  No, I&amp;#8217;m too old, right?&amp;#8221; with a sense of urgency and self-consciousness that&amp;#8217;s a bit worrying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this surprising at all?  I think it&amp;#8217;s not surprising to people who aren&amp;#8217;t my parents&amp;#8217; children; after all, humans are incredibly flawed and we&amp;#8217;ve got lots of dramas on Netflix that remind us of this over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; difficult to absorb that the sculptors of a sanctuary, that society says (through laws and media and whatnot) I&amp;#8217;m supposed to have, don&amp;#8217;t know that they don&amp;#8217;t know what they&amp;#8217;re doing and have caused near-irreparable damage to themselves and to me.  &amp;#8220;Family&amp;#8221; is &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be where you have a group of people, usually blood-related, who accept your faults and encourage you to grow, and who are people you can open up your emotions to and get help or help others.  At least, that&amp;#8217;s how &lt;em&gt;Full House&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Brady Bunch&lt;/em&gt; paints it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think that&amp;#8217;s great, that&amp;#8217;s really awesome, to have a private spot on Earth where you can just be yourself and not worry about the transience of that love and nurturing.  But I think people just watch these television families, fall in love with the consequences of what makes a great family great, and then build their own with paper mache and not warm flesh and blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &amp;#8220;consequences,&amp;#8221; I mean the grand holidays, the exchange of gifts, the nicknames, the hugs and kisses&amp;#8230; I mean, affection.  People crave to be loved and comforted so that they can rest and feel at peace, but they perform all these weird rituals of preparing for those events so that they &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; like they&amp;#8217;re loved and comforted instead of actually talking to each other to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; loved and comforted. Then people buy into these rituals so deeply that they are convinced that they are getting what they want, but are denied their true desires so that they end up feeling unsatisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t get me wrong; I think it&amp;#8217;s alright to decorate the Christmas tree, to cut the Thanksgiving turkey and to go trick-or-treating.  But I can&amp;#8217;t be misguided in thinking that we&amp;#8217;ve begun to cheapen these holidays by only craving and interacting with the veneers of them.  Holiday creep anyone??  I think seasonal gift-giving has become something of a spectacle to distract or dispel people from their thoughts that others don&amp;#8217;t remember or think much about them in usual day-to-day life.  It&amp;#8217;s become a mechanical vestige of what used to result from people caring about one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s so weird and funny to see how everything eventually boils down to people wanted to be loved and comforted since day one (their birth).  We are all gigantic children, wearing different customs and hats to try achieve this goal.  For example, academics might use esoteric vernacular, or at the very least, more crafted and elegant diction to sound intelligent so that they are accepted in their communities.  (&amp;lt;&amp;#8211; See what I did there?)  Sasha Strauss, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPnhg2YolHc&quot;&gt;in this brilliant video&lt;/a&gt;, says that brands like Nike, Apple, etc. are basically like people begging to be loved and recognized.  They&amp;#8217;re masked with logos and corporations but their &amp;#8220;strategies&amp;#8221; all aim to be adored by the masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, to the title of this post:  what does it mean to &amp;#8220;grow up&amp;#8221; (you can add the expletive in there if you want to read the question in my voice) ?   Does it mean &amp;#8220;playing the system&amp;#8221; to get what you want?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does it mean recognizing this embarrassing fault in humanity?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To refer to the first point, it&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;not at all&lt;/em&gt; a fault that we are creatures who need love.  I&amp;#8217;m actually pretty sure it&amp;#8217;s what got humans to cooperate and survive in the first place.  There&amp;#8217;s a great concept in &lt;em&gt;Ex Machina&lt;/em&gt; that&amp;#8217;s about how sexuality plays a huge role in what makes humans, human.  A paraphrase from the movie: What would two things do with each other if they weren&amp;#8217;t attracted to one another?  They&amp;#8217;d probably go off on their own things and never procreate or build things together.  And then they&amp;#8217;d eventually die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does it mean eschewing that childish desire to become an adult?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading this makes me think of a lot of villains in our books and TV shows, LOL.  Or tsunderes.  That whole, &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t need them!  I can be on my own!&amp;#8221; act that I&amp;#8217;ve gone through as a teenager.  I eventually learned in college that, actually, life is a lot easier, happier, and productive when you admit to others that you need their help and attention.  Not only do you actually get the love and comfort you need, you also find a lot of joy in fulfilling others&amp;#8217; needs for love and comfort.  This isn&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8220;childish&amp;#8221; in a derogatory sense at all!  What is &amp;#8220;childish&amp;#8221; about making life better and happier for everyone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does it mean &amp;#8220;playing the system&amp;#8221; to get what you want?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like this is basically what politics and marketing is about, lmao.  It&amp;#8217;s so centered on &amp;#8220;me, me, me.&amp;#8221;  Even if you fake empathy and kindness, if someone gets close enough to you, it will be evident that you&amp;#8217;re doing it all for yourself.  That you are trying to get what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think ignoring what &amp;#8220;you&amp;#8221; want is growing  up.  I think it&amp;#8217;s seeing that what &amp;#8220;they&amp;#8221; want &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; what &amp;#8220;you&amp;#8221; want that&amp;#8217;s growing  up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you are hungry for love and affection.  Yes, you are feeling lonely.  Yes, you have the tools to do something about it and find comfort.  But take a look at these thoughts&amp;#8211;it&amp;#8217;s all about you, you, you.  What about other people?  They are in pain, too, if not in &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; pain because there might actually be people out to kill and persecute them (e.g. anyone in a war-torn state).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are people in pain.  &lt;em&gt;There are people in pain.&lt;/em&gt;  I don&amp;#8217;t need to explain this one, do I?!  Every news channel reminds viewers of how much pain X country is in with their revolution, how much pain Y celebrity is having with a breakup, how much pain Z person suffered through discrimination or hatred.  You know what pain feels and looks like.  In fact, you might be in pain right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you have tools, and you are part of this huge party, or sinking ship, or whatever metaphor you want to use.  You can actually fix something.  You can actually do something.  No, you don&amp;#8217;t need to hide under the table because someone said you should.  No, you don&amp;#8217;t need permission to call out bullshit.  You can help!  You can help!!   And everyone, including you, will love some help!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you help out, or better yet, create opportunities for people to help out, you are loved and comforted.   Have you ever tutored someone, ever?    Have you made lunch for someone, ever?  Have you helped someone out of depression?  It&amp;#8217;s an awesome feeling because that person knows how to smile again.  You don&amp;#8217;t really think about yourself at that point. You might even realize that that&amp;#8217;s all you ever really wanted.  The love and comfort is a just a bonus.  It&amp;#8217;s the idea that you can be happy with someone else&amp;#8217;s happiness that &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#8217;t have to rely on the holiday sales, the approving smiles of our co-workers, the high grades and test scores, the slick technological gadgets, the TV show rerun binges, the pitiful reminiscing of childhood memories, the pointless one-night stands, the fake kisses and smiles, the flashy expensive clothing, the towering sculpturesque houses, the addiction to our phones and the Internet, the addiction to our drugs and caffeine, the number of loves and comments on our latest pic on our feeds, the obsessive adoration for clothing and food brands, or the disordered goals of extreme weight loss to make you happy.  Some of them are just bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think realizing this is growing up.  I think realizing that our happiness is strongly affected by something as powerful as another human&amp;#8217;s happiness, and not material, surface-level bullshit, is growing  up.  Moreover, to commit to that reality and not some delusional ideal is to grow up.  Done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Really, this show deconstructs a lot of things that people idealize, like fame, love, money, intellectualism, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**I&amp;#8217;m not going to paint myself as a saint or anything, so here goes.  Today I went to the Apple campus store to buy a shirt, which was sort of difficult because so many colors and sizes were sold out.  So my mom verbalized her theory, &amp;#8220;I bet that people from China are buying them in bulk to resell them at a higher price, look, look, look!&amp;#8221;&amp;#8211;&lt;em&gt;while two feet away from a Chinese man making a bulk purchase at the counter.&lt;/em&gt;  I was sick and tired of hearing my mom make these useless, negative generalizations, so I told her on an impulse, &amp;#8220;Mom, can you please just shut up?  I don&amp;#8217;t understand the point you&amp;#8217;re trying to make with those statements.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later out the store, she tried to justify to me that she was &amp;#8220;explaining&amp;#8221; what was happening to me and being informative.  I admonished her, saying that it was really rude for her to say that within earshot.  She said, &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t think he heard it!  I really don&amp;#8217;t think so!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad brought this incident up tonight, saying that my mom was upset that I had told her to shut up.  He then added that doing such a thing was absolutely unacceptable to do to parents.  I then said&amp;#8211;yeah, I definitely hit below the belt&amp;#8211;&amp;#8220;This is why you can&amp;#8217;t find a job nowadays.  You&amp;#8217;re so old-fashioned.  As far as I can tell, when there&amp;#8217;s bullshit, people call out on it.  That&amp;#8217;s how this generation works.  Every time you and Mom give me a piece of advice, I go out to the world and find that it&amp;#8217;s about 80% wrong.  And I know it hurts, I know it does!  But that&amp;#8217;s how it is&amp;#8211;keep up with the times.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being honest, I&amp;#8217;m actually not sure if telling your parents to shut up is not a &amp;#8220;totally unacceptable&amp;#8221; thing in my generation.  But I think it&amp;#8217;s a necessary thing in &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; case, because I&amp;#8217;ve tried being silent for a portion of my childhood and that didn&amp;#8217;t work out for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;***  Now that I see it, I kind of? did similar things to my parents, too.  Maybe suggesting that we not buy a fifth house is an &amp;#8220;unwarranted comment&amp;#8221; to them, though I think investing a couple hundred thousand dollars into a house is something that I, as an adult and eventual heir to my family&amp;#8217;s money, have a right to comment upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t really speak my mind as much anymore, though; I&amp;#8217;m starting to learn that vocalizing my opinions about small things to my parents is going to cause more harm than good for either of us.  But I do mention big things, such as my parents&amp;#8217; fixation on money and their inability to have a conversation that isn&amp;#8217;t about money.  They defend their views, saying that &amp;#8220;everything is money.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Blip</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Blip&amp;#8221; is a funny word.  It was the first word that popped into my head when I registered that I had to put in a title for this post.  It sounds like an onomatopoeia that describes its meaning, a sound that, for a tiny interval of time, pierces the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is what I want this current struggle in me to be like.  Go away soon, please!  It&amp;#8217;s weird that I&amp;#8217;m back to where I was in the beginning of last year, except that I know a lot more now.  Now I&amp;#8217;ve got a bird&amp;#8217;s eye view of what I was struggling with the entire year: values!  Just knowing that has been 90% of the battle.  To be more precise, I was struggling with figuring out what values to adopt.  I was experimenting with many aspects of my life to the extremes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of work (5 hrs/day) vs. nearly no work (3 hrs/week)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being unsocial (just in the dorm room all the time) vs. being social (scheduling lots of hangouts)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being very logical vs. being very emotional&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being uncommitted (no club activities) vs. throwing everything I&amp;#8217;ve got into a group (TEDxUCIrvine)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eating healthily vs. eating unhealthily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of exercise (nearly 5 mi/day) vs. no exercise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of math/science vs. lots of art/humanities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of money vs. scraping by&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of following directions (teamwork, classwork) vs. lots of inventive creativity (art, idea-making)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end of the school year, my values started to break down.  I was, subconsciously, trying replacing them with new ones.  And it&amp;#8217;s a painful process because there&amp;#8217;s that little moment when you feel like you aren&amp;#8217;t doing anything and you don&amp;#8217;t believe in anything and you&amp;#8217;re a blank slate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day during this summer so far, I&amp;#8217;ve felt this tension in my chest that I&amp;#8217;m a nobody right now, that I&amp;#8217;ve yet to become useful because I haven&amp;#8217;t been &amp;#8220;born&amp;#8221; yet.  I want to go out and do things.  But I&amp;#8217;m not even sure what things I want to do, let alone &amp;#8220;supposed&amp;#8221; to do.  For once in my life, I&amp;#8217;ve had to find out what I want; I&amp;#8217;ve had to educate myself &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to want&amp;#8211;a thing no one can tell you about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes something that would usually be perceived as &amp;#8220;bad&amp;#8221; would happen to me and I wouldn&amp;#8217;t feel anything.  Those moments make me happy and scared at the same time.  I&amp;#8217;m changing and it&amp;#8217;s possible to change my values (hooray).  On the other hand, where&amp;#8217;s the limit to which I can be complacent and okay with things?  I get scared that I forgot how to have emotions and care about things, to have a passion for something I&amp;#8217;d be willing to fight and die for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I get thrilled sometimes when I unexpectedly leap into a tirade or cry or feel sweet joy.  There &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; some soul within me that isn&amp;#8217;t indifferent to everything.  What usually triggers me are family, friends, how other people emote, etc.  For instance, memories of going to Great America in middle school still light up my heart.  And oddly enough, the pride I get from accomplishing an ICS project is quick and temporary, even if it&amp;#8217;s something that signifies how good I am at something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think my &amp;#8220;soul&amp;#8221; reacting and emoting to things is a rudiment of values, perhaps passed down genetically or evolutionarily.  And in response to the world I live in, I develop &amp;#8220;internal values&amp;#8221; that I can&amp;#8217;t even understand or seek out yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately I&amp;#8217;ve been just living.  I feel these little moments of perceiving these subtle layers of what it&amp;#8217;s like to live that goes beyond what words and images can explain&amp;#8230; it&amp;#8217;s those moments that vibrate in your bones, that feeling that is behind the urge to compel.  I also feel the itch to &amp;#8220;do something more,&amp;#8221; to fulfill my &amp;#8220;potential,&amp;#8221; to not just sit around and enjoy my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since that talk I had with Kevin, I realized that I&amp;#8217;ve been enjoying my life too little.  In high school and the past two years I&amp;#8217;ve felt some strange need to be pressurized all the time, to get things done.  That might be in the form of grades, being &amp;#8220;sufficiently social,&amp;#8221; creating enough artwork, and more.  To relax felt sinful.  To some expect, to not punish myself for relaxing was sinful, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I look back at my blog entries from middle school, though, it seems in those days I was content with &amp;#8220;just living.&amp;#8221;  I gleefully recalled, with great detail, everything that happened to me that day, down to line-by-line dialogue of people I wasn&amp;#8217;t even friends with.  All I talked about was stuff that happened to me, getting better at drawing, stuff I coveted, and my emotions towards people (especially frustration).  I wasn&amp;#8217;t obsessed with mastering academic things, nor was I really confused about who I was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know what happened but somewhere along the way in high school, I became very paranoid and anxious about everything&amp;#8230; perhaps the influence of my mom.  Perhaps it was the friends I hung out with, a generational thing.  Or, you know, all of that combined.  (I&amp;#8217;m looking through my entries in my old livejournal.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://misatotown.livejournal.com/2010/04/23/&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s where a noticeable change in my personality/writing happened.  I still wrote with lots of emoticons in later entries, though.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://misatotown.livejournal.com/2011/11/16/&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is another interesting post on work and values.)  I was also pretty precocious and self-aware for my age, though that fucked me over socially &lt;span class=&quot;wp-smiley wp-emoji wp-emoji-tongue&quot; title=&quot;:P&quot;&gt;:P&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been better at keeping myself sane lately.  I don&amp;#8217;t get as paranoid over things anymore.  Even when I &amp;#8220;try&amp;#8221; to, I think to myself, &amp;#8220;No wait&amp;#8211;this looks too different.  There&amp;#8217;s a lot of nuances that differentiate this experience from the last.&amp;#8221;  Or, I might tell myself, &amp;#8220;No, that took place a couple of weeks ago.  This looks the same, but it&amp;#8217;s actually different.  Things loop; that&amp;#8217;s normal.&amp;#8221;  Hooray!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there were themes for my life, it&amp;#8217;d be something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Middle school: having fun, making friends, encountering family problems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High school:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loss of friends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having to make new friends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disappointment/Trying to meet expectations is a HUGE one here&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being caught in consumerism/materialism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Living with bad parents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Living with someone who has mental issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identity&amp;#8211;sexuality, body image, intelligence, Summer in the City&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being good at things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First year of college:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Living without parents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Socializing&amp;#8230; oh JFC THIS one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realizing that there are tacit things that people, who had relatively normal childhoods, expect of you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realizing that I have to choose my own path&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obsession with love/savior thing and heartbreak&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What a heavy academic load feels like (hint:  shit)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutionalized school is mostly B.S.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weight gain and dieting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The power of logic, math, science&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orchestra culture, nerves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to think better, generally (HumCore)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Addiction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perspective, being really good at thinking like someone else&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second year of college:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nihilism and free will&amp;#8230; THIS one oh god&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;#8220;self&amp;#8221; beyond the self&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The power of perception and &amp;#8220;framing&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forgiving my mom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding what love is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Politics and communication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The meaning and feeling of giving it all for a team/committed cause&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Globalism, realizing that the world is huge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complexity in EVERYTHING, especially human emotion.  &amp;#8220;Modules&amp;#8221; within &amp;#8220;functions&amp;#8221; within &amp;#8220;functions&amp;#8221; within&amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initiative; understanding that no one will do shit unless you do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The importance of experience in relation to theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emotional control and learned apathy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breaking OUT of materialism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finding that I enjoy computer science&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Experimented with a lot of different values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if I were to predict what next year&amp;#8217;s themes will be, I think they will be&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Falling in love with a person, surrendering fear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Becoming passionate about things, especially computer science&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking leaps of faith and getting good at it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with a LOT of unfamiliar people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shaping and finding my identity and values&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attempts at leading people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being productive, accepting my moments of non-individuality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love and self-esteem with my self&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t think of any more.  I&amp;#8217;m gonna let life surprise me anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already feel a bit better!  :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should write and read my writings more.  I should read more in general&amp;#8230; I can see that I&amp;#8217;m trying to avoid reality by reading lots of fanfiction.&lt;/p&gt;
